BiznizQuest is a pixel style productivity app built with Next.js, React, and Supabase. It features a character system, gamified calendar, and background music to make your daily tasks more engaging.

## Features

- **Character System:** Choose character, set up your work life balance, and save notes.
- **Calendar System:** Manage your to-dos across a few different lists, and mark tasks as complete.
- **Vibes:** Enjoy relaxing music on login/signup and energetic tunes once inside.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js** (App Router, SSR/CSR)
- **React**
- **Supabase** (auth, database)
- **TypeScript**
- **Shadcn UI**
- **Lucide-react** (icons)

## Try it out

This will be deployed soon to <a href="https://bizniz.quest">bizniz.quest</a> where I need lots of feedback!
It's missing something, and that something is your help. :3
